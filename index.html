            <p>My name is Juan Delgado and welcome to my portfolio page. Iâ€™m 21 years old and graduated from Woodrow Wilson high school here in Dallas, Texas. Once I graduated my plan was to go to a community college for a year or so to save enough money to make it to a university. I attended Richland college for a few weeks when i was involved in a bad car accident. The accident caused many complications so i had to withdraw from school. After, I decided to work for a winery in the Lakewood area in East Dallas called "Times Ten Cellars". Then after talks with family members about my future and career i decided to look into IT world and computer programing caught my eye. </p>
            <p class="mb-0">My first step to accomplishing this was to attend school. I signed up for a coding bootcamp at SMU because it is a well-known university and that could be vital with job placement afterwards. The reason I decided to do programming was because I enjoy learning new things on my own. I also enjoy putting things together and making them function properly.  I see code as a big puzzle just waiting to be put together and that in the end is so satisfying.</p>
